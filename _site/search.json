Specifically, we will use the Tidyverse, an opinionated collection of R packages that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."

We will touch on R in various classes in two different modules Research Methods in Information Studies and User Studies and Information Behaviour. While this can be confusing, this website is thought to collect all R related teaching in one space and covers all aspects that happen in class. This means, this website is replacing course slides. Class preparation and reading material can be found on Moodle."

You need to install both parts to get everything to work. You can find the links to download both from Positâ€™s website. A detailed guide can also be found on the Moderndive website."

    "text": "Intalling and loading packages\nBase R can easily be extended by additional functions, data and routines that are wrapped in so called packages. R has a large community that develops packages on a daily basis which makes the programming language so accessible and versatile. Packages can either be installed via the RStudio GUI or via the console/your R code. You use the function install.packages() and put in the name of the package. As mentioned earlier we will use the tidyverse. We also start with a packages that gives us access to a popular data set, the palmer penguins data. After installing the packages you also need to make them accessible. This you do by using the function require() or library(). Note that for this function\n\n\nShow/Hide Code\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\nrequire(tidyverse)\nrequire(palmerpenguins)\n\n\n\nLet them eat cake\nWe"
