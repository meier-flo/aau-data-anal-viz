A core element of the AAU Information Studies degree is learning about data analysis and visualization. To teach you these skills, we use the [statistical programming language R](https://www.r-project.org/). Specifically, we will use the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), an opinionated collection of R packages that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 

## About this website
At AAU we use [Moodle](https://www.moodle.aau.dk/) to inform you about the different modules, their content and distribute reading and exercise material. We will touch on R in various classes in two different modules [Research Methods in Information Studies](https://www.moodle.aau.dk/course/view.php?id=51656) and [User Studies and Information Behaviour](https://www.moodle.aau.dk/course/view.php?id=51654). This can be confusing, that is why this website is thought to collect all **R related** teaching in one space and covers all aspects that happen in class. <mark>This means, this website is substituting the **course slides**. Additional material for e.g. preparation before class like reading material can be found on Moodle.</mark>

## R and RStudio Set-up
Chester Ismay and Albert Kim, the authors of [*Moderndive*](https://moderndive.com/index.html) an introductory book to Data Science using R and the Tidyverse, describe it like this: R is a programming language that runs computations, while RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. You need to install both parts to get everything to work. You can find the links [to download both from Posit's website.](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) A detailed guide can also be found on the [Moderndive website.](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html)

## Some general tips
* As a beginner it is always good to take a `"copy - paste - adpat"` approach to coding. Copy code from when you solved the same/similar problems, paste it and adapt it to the current situation (e.g. change the data frame and variable name).This is - especially at the beginning - easier than writing everything from scratch.
* Don't despair if your code throws an error. You can:
  * Put the error message in a search engine and look at the results. Most likely someone had the same issue before and asked about it on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
  * Use ChatGPT to come up with a suggestion on how to solve the problem.
* You want your object (e.g. data.frames, vectors or functions) to be descriptive, so youâ€™ll need a convention for multiple words. [Hadley Wickham recommends](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html?q=snake#whats-in-a-name) `snake_case` where you separate lowercase words with `_`. E.g.:
  + penguins_data
  + usasbility_test_results_1
  + participant_ids
  + calc_sus()
