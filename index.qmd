A core element of the AAU Information Studies degree is learning about data analysis and visualization. To teach you these skills, we use the [statistical programming language R](https://www.r-project.org/). Specifically, we will use the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), an opinionated collection of R packages that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 

## About this website
At AAU we use [Moodle](https://www.moodle.aau.dk/) to inform you about the different modules, their content and distribute reading and exercise material. We will touch on R in various classes in two different modules [Research Methods in Information Studies](https://www.moodle.aau.dk/course/view.php?id=51656) and [User Studies and Information Behaviour](https://www.moodle.aau.dk/course/view.php?id=51654). While this can be confusing, this website is thought to collect all **R related** teaching in one space and covers all aspects that happen in class. <mark>This means, this website is replacing **course slides**. Class preparation and reading material can be found on Moodle.</mark>

## R and RStudio Set-up
Chester Ismay and Albert Kim, the authors of [*Moderndive*](https://moderndive.com/index.html) an introductory book to Data Science using R and the Tiduverse, describe it like this: R is a programming language that runs computations, while RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. You need to install both parts to get everything to work. You can find the links [to download both from Posit's website.](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) A detailed guide can also be found on the [Moderndive website.](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html)
