Specifically, we will use the Tidyverse, an opinionated collection of R packages that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."

We will touch on R in various classes in two different modules Research Methods in Information Studies and User Studies and Information Behaviour. This can be confusing, that is why this website is thought to collect all R related teaching in one space and covers all aspects that happen in class. This means, this website is substituting the course slides. Material for preparation before class like reading material can be found on Moodle."

You need to install both parts to get everything to work. You can find the links to download both from Posit’s website. A detailed guide can also be found on the Moderndive website."

    "text": "Intalling and loading packages\nBase R can easily be extended by additional functions, data and routines that are wrapped in so called packages. R has a large community that develops packages on a daily basis which makes the programming language so accessible and versatile. Packages can either be installed via the RStudio GUI or via the console/your R code. You use the function install.packages() and put in the name of the package. As mentioned earlier we will use the tidyverse. We also start with a packages that gives us access to a popular data set, the palmer penguins data. After installing the packages you also need to make them accessible. This you do by using the function require() or library(). Note that packages only need to be installed once. However, everytime you reopen your RStudio, you also need to make the package accessible again via either require() or library().\n\n\nShow/Hide Code\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\nrequire(tidyverse)\nrequire(palmerpenguins)\n\n\n\nLet them eat cake\nLet’s have a look at the penguins data and do a first little bar chart of the penguins.\n\n\nShow/Hide Code\n# We save the built-in dataset into a data.frame/tibble that lives in your environment.\npenguins_data&lt;-penguins\npenguins_data\n\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 8\n   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n   &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7               181        3750\n 2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4               186        3800\n 3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18                 195        3250\n 4 Adelie  Torgersen           NA            NA                  NA          NA\n 5 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3               193        3450\n 6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6               190        3650\n 7 Adelie  Torgersen           38.9          17.8               181        3625\n 8 Adelie  Torgersen           39.2          19.6               195        4675\n 9 Adelie  Torgersen           34.1          18.1               193        3475\n10 Adelie  Torgersen           42            20.2               190        4250\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n# ℹ 2 more variables: sex &lt;fct&gt;, year &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nShow/Hide Code\npenguins_data%&gt;%ggplot(aes(species))+geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImporting data from files\nThe tidyverse has a package called readr that is specifically dedicated to load various kinds of files, e.g. .csv, .tsv, excel and so on."
